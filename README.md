This is a modified version of [Aimmy](https://github.com/Babyhamsta/Aimmy)

I decided to make this due to Aimmy deciding to go closed-source.
I have tried to add features that i have seen in the Aimmy-V2 previews and features that have been suggested to me.
I have also changed the namespace and over identifiers/flags so that it is less likely to get you banned on games.


Some main things that make this better than the last published open-source version of Aimmy:

It has instant model switching to remove the lag inbetween.  
I have copyed the V2 UI to make it look nicer and up to date.  
It has recoil control.  
It has notifications for model/config loading.  


If you want to compile your own version i highly recommend changed the default namespace and assembaly name in project settings to give it unique identifiers.
It needs to be compiled as x64.
